1. What's the use of where keyword. -> I looked up the docs https://wiki.haskell.org/Keywords#where - doesn't seem to be anything important. Seems to be boilerplate.

2. "Leibniz equality: in any context, we can replace an object with anything equivalent
to it. Therefore, in Haskell, we reason about computation by reasoning about
*equality* of (sub-)expressions."
I didn't quite get this. 
For the example given (and the recursions at the end), it feels like it can be the same in other languages. 
I'm guessing it has something to do with side effects - but not too sure.

3. What's the purpose of unit type/value? 
I see it's used in IO ()?
Is there something analogous in other languages?


4. One major difference between Haskell and other programming languages is that
Haskell uses a "call-by-need" semantics for evaluation, aka "lazy" evaluation.
What this means is that Haskell does not evaluate arguments before calling
functions. Instead, expressions are only evaluated when they are needed.

In the section that follows the above statement, it's mostly about short circuiting, which is applicable in other languages as well.
I was a bit confused by this part till I got to the infinite lists part in the end.


5. There seems to be a typo in the following section.
{-
In contrast, you can see that if the first argument were `False` instead,
it does not short circuit and does not trigger the error.
-}
and does not trigger the error -> and does trigger the error


6. 
query :: IO ()
query = do
  putStr "What is your name? "
  n <- getLine
  let y :: String
      y = "Welcome to CIS 552 " ++ n
  putStrLn y

The let keyword seems to have been used for the first time here, 


query :: IO ()
query = do
  putStr "What is your name? "
  n <- getLine
  let y :: String
      y = "Welcome to CIS 552 " ++ n
  putStrLn y
let?
Seems to be needed inside do

String concatenation double +.




When we sequence actions of type `IO ()` there is no need to name the
result. These actions do not return anything interesting. We could name the
result if we wanted (such as `_m` below);
Would there be any benefits to  define an unused variable.

I had a slight misunderstanding here, with the wording "no need to name the result"
It sounded like for functions which do return a result, it is necessary to name the result.
But for the getLine function, it looks like we can ignore it.
(In some C++ code, I've seen the return value used only for erroneous conditinos. The error flag would be bassed by reference.)

If return type, can ignore?



Actually, the compiler won't let you construct a tuple with more
than 62 values, but it would be bad style to do so anyways
What's the signifiance of 62?


act2 :: (IO (), IO ())
act2 = (putStr "Hello", putStr "Hello")
-> Hello1 and Hello2

Since we're running them in different orders.



There is no limit to
the number of values that can be stored in a list -> Does this also have the 62 restriction?



The infix operator `:` constructs a new list, by adding a new element to the
front of an existing list. (Note, the existing list is not modified.)
Note, the existing list is not modified -> This looks like the operation is expensive sice it would require a copy. 
Are there any operations which do not require copy? I think variables are supposed to be immutable which is where this comes from.
"adding a new element to the front of an existing list" -> I may be too used to how other languages work, but they usually add elements to the end of the list 
(perhaps for efficiency reasons). There would be ways to append to the end of the list, but why is prepending to the list the "default" way?
i.e. is there a 
cons :: [a] -> a -> [a]?


Very long line?
